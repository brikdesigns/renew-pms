#!/usr/bin/env bash
# worktree-guard.sh — verify the primary worktree isn't sitting on a task branch.
#
# Why this exists: the primary checkout at `/Documents/GitHub/brik/brik-bds`
# is the shared reference copy. When a session silently switches it to a
# `task/*` branch — usually via a SessionStart hook or a manual checkout
# that was never reverted — every subsequent agent inherits the wrong state.
# The 2026-04-21 Phase B incident captured this class of bug: an agent's
# WIP on `task/industry-navigation-ia` was sitting in the primary worktree
# while a concurrent session tried to do Theming cleanup from the same path.
# Files got cross-contaminated across branches.
#
# The rule: the primary worktree lives on `main`. Task work lives in
# `../brik-bds-worktrees/{slug}`. See scripts/new-task.sh.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/worktree-guard.sh           # warn only (exit 0)
#   ./scripts/worktree-guard.sh --strict  # fail on violation (exit 1)
#   ./scripts/worktree-guard.sh --json    # structured output for hooks
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  — primary is on main (or we're not in the primary)
#   1  — primary is on a task branch (only when --strict)
#   2  — not inside a git repo / invocation error
